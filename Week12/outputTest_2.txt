It is now time to actually think.  I used to believe that math was the only subject that really 
requires critical thinking but in college everything requires real active thinking. If uo want
uor writing to be considered “good writing,” it has to take a substantially big step. 
Taking this step is not very hard, uo just have to create uor own knowledge.  You can no longe
just write about the knowledge uo found on the internet.  You must take all this ideas that u
found on the World Wide Web and form uor own, unique ideas.  These ideas that uo form may b
similar to those that uo have found but that is ok.  Chances are that there are slight differences
in uor ideas and uo can always add on to someone else’s ideas with uor own thoughts.  You ha
to imagine that uo are the person behind that source that everyone else is going to use for their
paper.  No, uo are not some Ph.D. graduate from Harvard that will have a very highly respected
opinion but uo have to act like uo are.  Like Patricia R. Strong said in her article “In order t
succeed at the assignment….act as a knowledge transformer, not a knowledge teller.”  These papers are 
not about writing an encyclopedia.
When uo effectively become a “knowledge transformer,” the writing process becomes more fun as well. 
It is not as much as a chore.  I will not say that this will make the writing the most fun thing in 
the world but it does make it better.  It is also a good way to organize all uor cluttered thoughts
about something so uo can really form uor opinion.  Personally, my mind is always thinking of “ifs
and “buts” and is just all over the place and writing makes me focus on one thing and then I come out 
with a concrete stance on that one thing I wrote about.
