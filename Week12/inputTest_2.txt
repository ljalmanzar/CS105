It is now time to actually think.  I used to believe that math was the only subject that really 
requires critical thinking but in college everything requires real active thinking. If you want 
your writing to be considered “good writing,” it has to take a substantially big step.  
Taking this step is not very hard, you just have to create your own knowledge.  You can no longer 
just write about the knowledge you found on the internet.  You must take all this ideas that you 
found on the World Wide Web and form your own, unique ideas.  These ideas that you form may be 
similar to those that you have found but that is ok.  Chances are that there are slight differences 
in your ideas and you can always add on to someone else’s ideas with your own thoughts.  You have 
to imagine that you are the person behind that source that everyone else is going to use for their 
paper.  No, you are not some Ph.D. graduate from Harvard that will have a very highly respected 
opinion but you have to act like you are.  Like Patricia R. Strong said in her article “In order to 
succeed at the assignment….act as a knowledge transformer, not a knowledge teller.”  These papers are 
not about writing an encyclopedia.
When you effectively become a “knowledge transformer,” the writing process becomes more fun as well.  
It is not as much as a chore.  I will not say that this will make the writing the most fun thing in 
the world but it does make it better.  It is also a good way to organize all your cluttered thoughts 
about something so you can really form your opinion.  Personally, my mind is always thinking of “ifs” 
and “buts” and is just all over the place and writing makes me focus on one thing and then I come out 
with a concrete stance on that one thing I wrote about.
